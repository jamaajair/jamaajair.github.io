    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a passionate and dedicated computer science student.<br>
      I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Liège, where I built strong foundations in software engineering, computer systems,
      and networks.<br>
      Today, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, specializing in Computer Systems Security.<br>
      My passion lies in technology, with a particular focus on computer networks and cybersecurity. I am always eager to learn,
      improve my skills, and take on new challenges.<br>
      I enjoy exploring how systems interact, how they can be secured, and how technology can be used to solve complex problems.<br>

    <h2>Notable projects</h2>
    <p>During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work on various projects. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the <strong>Securing Networks</strong> course: implemented a rogue access point with a fake Wi-Fi portal requiring users to provide data to connect.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>Compilers</strong> course: implemented a compiler for the VSOP language, covering all five stages: lexing, parsing, annotated tree generation, semantic analysis, and LLVM IR code generation.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>Introduction to Computer Security</strong> course: designed a network architecture including firewall and proxy configuration and setup of various servers.</li>
      <li>Implemented a <strong>Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)</strong> format to handle large sparse matrices efficiently, enabling fast matrix multiplication and solving linear systems.</li>
      <li>Built and sent <strong>DNS queries</strong> to the university DNS server and processed the responses as part of a networking project.</li>
      <li>Worked on <strong>eBPF projects</strong>, including implementing a file system for a disk, a scheduler simulator in C covering various scheduling algorithms, and a kernel module to list processes, group them by shared page table entries, and display their information.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> course: implemented various data structures (arrays, linked lists, hash tables, trees, graphs) and applied dynamic programming techniques.</li>
    </ul>
